Created by Jeremy Speth & Arush Prashar

This project solves the game of rush hour and outputs the minimum number of moves given input in the form of:
2 h 1 4
where the first indicates length of vehicle(2-3), the second indicates horizontal or vertical orientation, and the following indicate row and column respectively. The first entry is the main car trying to exit.
The technique for solving this problem uses a breadth-first-search. Any 6x6 board can be solved using this program!
